People can create events and invite users. Invited users gets to rsvp. Events with guests who all rsvp gets the status of 'confirmed'. Easy to keep track of all events you have created and been invited to.

Ideally, it would be an application where all of your guests get to pick from a range of available dates and the host will confirm among the most selected available date.
